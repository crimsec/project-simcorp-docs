# Project SimCorp Docs

Crimson Security has been contracted to perform a one-time adversary emulation engagement for SimCorp and evaluate the security posture of the company's cloud system on AWS. This task involves enumerating the target network from a "black box" position (minimal knowledge of the target environment) and starting with a foothold on a single endpoint. Our goals are to discover as many vulnerabilities as we can and document them in accordance with community resources such as CWE and CVSS as well as applying TTPs perform exploits as the opportunities present themselves. The following documents show how we went about executing TTPs and whether they were successful or not.
